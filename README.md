## 🔍 Introduction

Predicting property prices is essential for real estate buyers, sellers, and investors. This project aims to:

- Analyze key factors influencing property prices.
- Build a robust ML model to predict real estate prices.
- Provide valuable insights into real estate trends.

The model is trained using **machine learning techniques**, with an emphasis on **data cleaning, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning**.

## 🛠 Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection** - Collect real estate data containing various property attributes.
2. **Data Preprocessing** - Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale numerical data.
3. **Feature Engineering** - Select the most relevant features for the model.
4. **Model Selection & Training** - Compare different ML models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, XGBoost, etc.).
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning** - Optimize the model for better performance.
6. **Evaluation & Predictions** - Assess model accuracy using performance metrics.
7. **Deployment** - Deploy the model using Flask API on AWS EC2.

## 🏗️ Model Training

The following models were tested:

1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Decision Tree Regressor**
3. **Random Forest Regressor**
4. **XGBoost Regressor** (Final Model)

- **Best Model Selection Criteria:**
  - Higher **R² score** (explains variance in data)
  - Lower **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error)
  - Robustness against overfitting

- **Final Model Used:** **XGBoost Regressor**
- **Hyperparameter Tuning Method:** Grid Search / Random Search

## ☁️ EC2 Deployment Guide

- Launch EC2 Ubuntu instance
- Allow inbound rules: **SSH, HTTP, HTTPS**
- Generate `.pem` key → convert to `.ppk` using **PuTTYgen**
- SSH into instance via Git Bash:
```bash
ssh -i <path-to-pem> ubuntu@<public-dns>
```

### WinSCP Setup:
- Host: Public DNS of EC2
- Username: `ubuntu`
- Auth: Add `.ppk` in Advanced > SSH > Authentication

### Web Server Setup:
- Install NGINX & Python3 venv
- Navigate to `/var/www/html` or redefine root in `bhp.conf`
- Activate your virtual environment:
```bash
cd BHP/server
source venv/bin/activate
python3 server.py
```

### Access the Server:
- Copy EC2 **Public DNS** in browser after server runs
- You’ll see your deployed app live on the internet ✅
